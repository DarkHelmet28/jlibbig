  <b>General Structure:</b> 
  <br />
  Strings can have three section, only appearing in this order:
  <br />
  <code>
  &nbsp; &#60;signature section&#62;
  <br />
  &nbsp; &#60;reaction rules section&#62;
  <br />
  &nbsp; &#60;bigraphs section&#62;
  <br />
  </code>
  Every section can also be empty, but if a bigraph with controls is defined, then its controls must appear in the signature section.
  <br />
  </p><p>
  <b>Signature:</b>
  <br />
  In the signature section, controls must be defined as it follow:
  <br />
  <code>
  &nbsp; %active name : num ;
  <br />
  &nbsp; %passive name : num ;
  <br />
  </code>
  where <code>name</code> is the name of the control and <code>num</code> is the number of its ports.
  <br />
  </p><p>
  <b>Reaction rule:</b>
  Reaction rules are defined as it follow:
  <br />
  <code>
  &nbsp; redex -> reactum ;
  <br />
  </code>
  where <code>redex</code> and <code>reactum</code> are two bigraph.
  </p><p>
  Bigraphs in the bigraph section are separated by semicolon.
  <br />
  Syntax and semantic of bigraph , redex and reactum are the same. 
  </p><p>
  <b>Bigraph grammar:</b>
  <br />
  <code>
  &nbsp; B ::= B || B <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= B | B <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= B.B <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= &#60;name/nameslist&#62; <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= &#60;name/nameslist&#62; B <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= C[names] <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= $integer <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= 0 <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= 1 <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= nil <br />
  &nbsp; B ::= ( B ) <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp; C ::= <i>control's name</i> <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp; nameslist ::= name , nameslist <br />
  &nbsp; nameslist ::= name <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp; name ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9] <br />
  &nbsp; name ::= - <br />
  </code>
  In addition: 
  <br /> 
  <code>names</code> can be empty. 
  <br />
  In the occurrences of <code>&#60;name/names&#62;</code>, <code>name</code> can be empty.
  <br />
  Every name can be preceded by <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>, indicating if they refer to a inner or outername. names without + or - will be treated as outernames.
  <br />
  </p><p>
  <b>Bigraph operations:</b>
<br />
  The following list is ordered according to the operators' precedence, from highest to lowest.
  <br />
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> : composition of two bigraphs. The inner face of the first bigraph will be linked with the outerface of the second bigraph. If some names of the first bigraph's innerface doesn't occur in the second bigraph's outerface, then they will be added and will appear in the composed bigraph's innerface. The same applies to the second's bigraph outerface.
<li><code>&#60;name/nameslist&#62</code> : followed by a bigraph, this construct will modify the bigraph's link graph. <code>name</code> (if not empty) is an outername and will appear in the resulting bigraph's outerface. This outername will be linked with every name in the <code>nameslist</code>. If <code>name</code> is empty, names in the list will be linked together with a new edge. Names in the list will be then composed with bigraph's outerface, with the same rules of composition. If <code>&#60;name/nameslist&#62</code> isn't followed by a bigraph, it represent the resulting bigraph of the operation <code>&#60;name/nameslist&#62 0</code> (where <code>0</code> is the empty bigraph).
<li><code>|</code> : juxtaposition of two bigraphs, followed by a merging of all roots (the resulting bigraph will only have one root). if bigraphs have some outernames in common, they will be connected in the resulting bigraph.
<li><code>||</code> : juxtaposition of two bigraphs (without merging roots).
</ul>
